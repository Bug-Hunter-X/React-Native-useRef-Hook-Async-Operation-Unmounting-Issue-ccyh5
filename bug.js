This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the callback function within `useRef` is executed.  This typically happens when you have a `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or other asynchronous operation scheduled within `useRef`'s callback, and the component unmounts before the callback fires.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const intervalRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
      console.log('Interval running');
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

If `MyComponent` unmounts before the `setInterval` callback executes even once, you might encounter this issue, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior.
